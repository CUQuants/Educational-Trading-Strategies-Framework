## Usage

1. Run the script:

## Example
```
Enter stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT): AAPL
Use default date range (1 year)? (y/n): y

Select a trading strategy:
1. Moving Average Crossover
2. Mean Reversion (Bollinger Bands)
3. Custom Strategy (RSI + Moving Average)

Enter your choice (1-3): 1

Set Moving Average Crossover parameters:
Short window length (default=20): 
Long window length (default=50):
```

## Strategies Explained
### Moving Average Crossover
Uses two moving averages of different periods to generate signals. A buy signal occurs when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA (golden cross). A sell signal occurs when the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA (death cross).

### Mean Reversion (Bollinger Bands)
Based on the concept that prices tend to revert to their mean. Uses Bollinger Bands (mean Â± standard deviation) to identify overbought/oversold conditions. Buy when price touches lower band, sell when price touches upper band.

### Custom Strategy (RSI + Moving Average)
Combines Relative Strength Index (RSI) with moving averages. Buy when RSI is below a threshold (oversold) AND price is above MA. Sell when RSI is above a threshold (overbought) OR price falls below MA.

### Limitations
